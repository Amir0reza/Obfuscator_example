This is the answer of for hiding the javascript file for the front end

I have consider a sample project of mine which is simple as an example.
tryed to do the Ofuscate method to hide the code

The method I have considered was to use "javascript-obfuscator" module
Since the implementation was easy and the result was acceptable
